# RemoteAssistanceAR

This directory contains a Unity project used in the study for my master's thesis. The project is designed to guide the user through a series of tasks via voice commands, with the user pressing buttons in response. The Stroop effect is applied to increase difficulty. 

The tasks are designed to test various aspects of user performance under different conditions of feedback, with the project recording a range of dependent, independent, and control variables.

The project generates a `data.csv` file with recorded data.

**Dependent Variables:**
- Anzahl Errors
- Task Completion Time
- Reaction Time
- Time in Zone
- NASA TLX vs Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART)
  - Mental
  - Physical
  - Temporal
  - Performance
  - Effort
  - Frustration
- UEQ-S
  - Pragmatic Quality
  - Hedonic Quality
  - Overall

**Independent Variables:**
- Conditions
  - Audio
  - Audio + Visual
  - Audio + EMS
  - Audio + Visual + EMS

**Control Variables:**
- Age
- Sex
- Prior VR-Experience
- Prior EMS-Experience
- Literacy & Colorblindness 
- Main Hand
- EMS Calibration Strength
- EMS Frequency (100Hz)
- EMS Pulse Width (250Âµs)
