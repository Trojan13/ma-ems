# BLE_Emulator_JAVA

This directory contains a Java implementation of reverse-engineered Android app classes to simulate the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Packet generation of the Beurer EM70 device. This was investigated as a potential entry point for EMS research, providing an easily purchasable and controllable device via BLE, which is suitable for studies related to EMS.
