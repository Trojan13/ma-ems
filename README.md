# An Explorative study on the Impact of Electrical Muscle Stimulation on User Performance and Experience in Virtual Reality Remote Assistance

This repository contains the work and code related to my master's thesis, which investigates the impact of Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) feedback on remote assistance tasks within a virtual reality (VR) environment. The study compares the performance of participants when using EMS feedback to a control group without it, aiming to determine the potential benefits of incorporating EMS into remote assistance systems.

## Contents
* `BLE_Emulator_JAVA`: A Java implementation of reverse-engineered Android app classes to simulate the BLE Packet generation of the EM70 device.
* `BLE_Emulator_Python`: A Python implementation of the BLE communication with the EM70 device, including a WebSocket server for frontend communication.
* `RemoteAssistanceAR`: A Unity project that was used to conduct the study, featuring an interactive task for participants to perform, involving voice commands and button presses under different feedback conditions.
* `emscontrolfrontend`: A frontend application for sending BLE packets to the EM70 device and controlling it.
* `study`: Files related to the study, including analysis, data, visualizers, and exported LimeSurvey.org templates.
* `StroopTestVisualizer`: Javascript tool to generate and visualize the Stroop-Color-Sequences.
